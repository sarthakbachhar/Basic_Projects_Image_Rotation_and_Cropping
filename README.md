# Image Manipulation: Rotate and Crop

This project demonstrates how to rotate and crop an image using Python's `PIL` (Pillow) library. The image undergoes a 45-degree rotation followed by a crop operation, and the results are displayed using `matplotlib`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Pillow (`pip install pillow`)
- Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`)

## Features

- Rotate an image by 45 degrees.
- Crop a section of the rotated image.
- Display the original, rotated, and cropped images side by side.

## Usage

1. Ensure the image file is located at the specified path.
2. Modify the file path in the code if necessary.
3. Run the script to perform the operations and display the results:

   ```bash
   python rotate_crop_image.py

4. The cropped and rotated image will also be saved as cropped_lsd.png.
